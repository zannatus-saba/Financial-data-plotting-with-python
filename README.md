# Financial-data-plotting-with-python

For this code, I used one day of TAQ data (March 1, 2021) and changed the datetime variable as '%Y-%m-%d %H%M%S%f'. 

Also, I grouped the data according to the datetime variable by 1 minute. I chose one stock (Disney- DIS) and plotted it's stock price. 

I analyzed retail activity

what type of stocks do retail traders like?

I analyzed aggregate dollar volume,

Average price 

Retun volatility

Average trade size

The ranked the retail activity by dollar volume 

Calculated average price and return volatility of the retail rank and plotted both in bar graphs
